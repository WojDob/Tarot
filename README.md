# Tarot

This is a simple script which loads a deck of tarot cards from deck.txt, shuffles the deck and reads the top three cards. 
The interpretation of the cards is entirely up to you.
The script saves the shuffled deck after reading your fate, just for a bit of authenticity - to make it more like a physical deck of tarot cards.

To use, please run 'tarot.py'.
